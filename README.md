# QualityPrediction
KNN- Gaussian Naive Bayes  and Bernoulli Bayes classifiers to predict the quality of wine.
This ML model is built to predict the quality of wine based on given features. The data set given contains eleven features that are key in wine quality. As the first step of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) the basic statistics of the data set was captured and visualized in boxplots, scatter plots and density plots. The EDA and research about the features that determine the quality of wine aided in spotting missing values and outliers which could have caused biased to our ML model. The outliers and missing values were dropped from data set.Though there are 11 features in the data set not all of them affect the quality of the wine. To check this correlation matrix and bar graph was plotted.
